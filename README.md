# MyWeightOnMars
Mars' gravity is about 38% of Earth's. Write a program that will calculate your weight on Mars.
Assumptions:
- declare all variables at the top of the class,
- all variables, apart from the name that complies with the "clean code" rules, should also contain your surname, for example: float marsWeightBielecki; ,
- initial variables are to be of float type,
- after making the calculations, assign the result to a new variable, this time of the double type,
- after assigning the assignment, write the variable double to the console, limiting its length to 4 decimal places,
- cast the above variable of double type to a new variable of int type,
- cast the above variable of type int to a new variable of type char,
- do any math operation on this variable char type and assign the value of this activity to the new variable int type.
Each of the above actions should be written to the console, adding some text explaining what has been done.
